        <p id="process-description">I got the dataset for this website from my partner, Jonga Fan. Jonga compiled a playlist of songs, and then sorted them by genre, rating, and activity that he listens to them during. I was then given the set and had to choose how I best thought the data could be shared. I decided to create a website that allows the user to sort through the songs based on what activity they are doing. I included images of Jonga's airtable along with my initial figma iteration.</p>
